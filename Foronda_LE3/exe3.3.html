        <h1>Elaica Joy Dela Cruz</h1><hr>
        <p>Laica has been my classmate since the first term of my first-year. We didn't talk with each other until the creation of <br>
        our project for our Filipino subject. Since then, we talk about many things like anime, k-pop, and games. I'm very thankful that she <br>
        is always by my side through good and bad times. I promise to cherish my time with her for my whole life.</p>
